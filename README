# UnityTools
A bunch of unity scripts, tools, and shaders (new and mods of other projects) to automate things, speed up development, and optimize workflow.

Tools are provided as is, without any warranty or liability. Do what you want with them, but these tools were made for my needs, so keep backups and don't blame me if something goes wrong.

Any script, tool, or shader modifications ownership remains with the original authors.
